This directory is a source-code repository containing Genode-specific
services and applications. In contrast to the components that come with
the 'os' repository, programs contained in 'gems' are able to leverage
the functionalities provided by higher-level repositories such as 'libports'.
To use the 'gems' repository, make sure to also add those repositories to your
build configuraion.
