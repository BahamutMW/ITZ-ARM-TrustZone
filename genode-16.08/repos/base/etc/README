This directory contains default configuration files that are used
by the '<role>.mk' files in the 'mk/' directory. By
convention, configuration files are first read from here
followed by a corresponding config file in '<builddir>/etc/'.


Convention
~~~~~~~~~~

We include config files directly into makefiles. So the basic
makefile syntax applies here, too.

Config files should
* Have '.conf' as filename extension.
* Use only assignments but provide no rules or other 'make'-magic.
* Not include other files!
