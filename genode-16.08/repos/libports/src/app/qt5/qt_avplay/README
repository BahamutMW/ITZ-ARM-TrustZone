This directory contains a simple Qt-based media player which is actually a
graphical user interface for the SDL-based 'avplay' media player from 'libav'.
It starts 'avplay' as a child and shows its graphical output in a
'QNitpickerViewWidget'. The widgets for controlling the player state send the
according keyboard and mouse input events to 'avplay'.

The 'qt_avplay' player supports the following configuration options:

:'<mediafile name="..."/>:'
  name of the media file to play

:'<framebuffer_filter name="..." ram_quota="..."/>':

  This node contains the name of a framebuffer filter service to filter the
  video output. It may appear multiple times. If specified more than once, it
  is possible to build a post-processing pipeline for the video display where
  each processing stage is executed by a separate program.
