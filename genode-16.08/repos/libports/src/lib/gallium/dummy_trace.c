/*
 * \brief  Dummy stub for trace driver
 * \author Norman
 * \date   2010-07-12
 *
 * The Intel driver contains a hard-coded initialization of the trace driver.
 * With the dummy stub, we avoid having to use the trace driver. Using the
 * trace driver would implicate the need for a working pthreads implementation,
 * which we don't have yet.
