 * \brief  Clipping guard
 * \author Norman Feske
 * \date   2006-08-08
 *
 * When drawing views recursively, we need to successively shrink the clipping
 * area to the intersection of the existing clipping area and the area of the
 * current view. After each drawing operation, we want to restore the previous
 * clipping area. The clipping guard functions the same way as a lock guard.
 * The clipping area of the canvas that is specified at the constructor of the
 * clipping guard gets shrinked as long as the clip guard exists. When we leave
 * the drawing function, all local variables including the clipping guard gets
 * destroyed and the clipping guard's destructor resets the clipping area of
 * the canvas.
 *
 * This mechanism effectively replaces the explicit clipping stack of the
 * original Nitpicker version by folding the clipping stack into the normal
 * stack.
