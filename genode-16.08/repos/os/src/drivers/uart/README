This driver operates the UARTs on the given platform. It provides the
'Terminal_session' interface for output via serial line.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server supports the following configuration options, supplied
via Genode's config mechanism.

:Routing clients to specific UARTs:

  Depending on the underlying hardware platform, the UART server is
  configurable to route specific clients to distinct UARTs. There is
  no default routing, so the configuration is mandatory. UART 0 is
  assumed to be used by the kernel and, therefore, left untouched.

  ! <config>
  !   <policy label="test-uart1" uart="1" detect_size="yes" />
  !   <policy label="test-uart2" uart="2" />
  !   <policy label="test-uartx" uart="1" />
  ! </config>

  If the 'detect_size' attribute is set to "yes", the UART driver will
  try to detect the terminal size of the connected remote terminal using
  a protocol of escape sequences. If not specified, the UART driver will
  report a size of (0, 0) to the terminal-session client.
