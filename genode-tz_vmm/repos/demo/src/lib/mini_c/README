Mini C library

This library only provides the libc support for libz, libpng,
and DOpE. Most functions are not implemented. The implemented
functions might be slightly incompatible to a real libc.
Please use this library with caution!

If you require libc support that goes beyond simple string
functions for your application, please consider porting a
real libc to Genode instead of enhancing mini_c.
