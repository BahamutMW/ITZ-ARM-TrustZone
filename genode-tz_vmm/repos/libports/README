This directory contains ports of popular 3rd-party software to Genode.


Usage
-----

At the root of the 'libports' repository, there is 'Makefile' automating the
task of downloading and preparing the library source codes. By just typing
'make', you get an overview of the available libraries and further
instructions.

In the common case, you might just want to prepare all packages by issuing:
! make prepare

Alternatively, you can select individual packages to prepare by specifying
their base names (without the version number) as command-line argument. For
example, the following command prepares both the C library and the Freetype
library:
! make prepare PKG="libc freetype"

After having prepared the 'libports' repository, you are ready to include the
repository into the build process by appending it to the 'REPOSITORIES'
declaration of your '<build-dir>/etc/build.conf' file.


Under the hood
--------------

For each library, there is a file contained in the 'libports/ports/'
subdirectory. The file is named after the library and contains the
library-specific rules for downloading the source code and installing header
files.


How does 'libports' relate to the other repositories?
-----------------------------------------------------

Most libraries hosted in the 'libports' repository expect a complete C library,
which is provided with the 'libc' package. Please do not forget to prepare the
libc package when using any of the other libports packages. The libc, in turn,
depends on the 'os' repository for its back end. Because the 'os' repository is
the home of the dynamic linker, libraries contained in 'libports' are safe to
assume the presence of the dynamic linker and, thus, should be built as shared
libraries.
