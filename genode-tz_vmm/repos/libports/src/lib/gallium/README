This directory contains pseudo targets for building Gallium drivers.  These
drivers are not directly linked against applications. Instead, they are loaded
as needed by using 'dlopen'. Because no application directly depends on any
driver library, none of these libraries is built by default. To enforce
building a driver library, we introduce a dummy program, which depends on the
respective library. The program itself is worthless, but as a side effect,
the driver library gets built.
