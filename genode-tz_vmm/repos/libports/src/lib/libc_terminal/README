The 'libc_terminal' plugin allows the use of Genode's terminal-session
interface via file operations of the C library. The plugin responds to opening
requests for the file "/dev/terminal". Read and write operations referring to
the resulting file descriptor are redirected to a terminal service as defined
via Genode's service routing policy. The plugin supports 'read', 'write',
'stat', and 'select'.
