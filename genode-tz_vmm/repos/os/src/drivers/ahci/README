This directory contains the implementation of Genode's AHCI driver

Behavior
--------

The driver supports x86 32/64 bit platforms and the Exynos5 SOC. If
more than one AHCI controller is present, the first one will be used.
Each active device on each AHCI port will be represented by a Genode
block session. The server must be configured via a policy, that states
which client can access a certain device:


!<start name="ahci">
!  <binary name="ahci_drv" />
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="10M" />
!  <provides><service name="Block" /></provides> }
!  <route>
!    <any-service> <parent /> <any-child /> </any-service>
!  </route>
!  <config>
!    <policy label="test-ahci" device="0" />
!    <policy label="bench" device="1" />
!  </config>
!</start>

In the example above, a session request labeled with "test-ahci"
gains access to device 0, while "bench" gains access to device 1.
