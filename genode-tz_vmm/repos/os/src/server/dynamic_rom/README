ROM service that provides ROM modules that change during the lifetime of a ROM
session according to a timeline. This main purpose of this service is the
testing of programs that are able to respond to ROM module changes, for example
configuration changes.

The configuration of the dynamic ROM server contains a '<rom>' sub node per
ROM module provided by the service. Each '<rom>' node hosts a 'name' attribute
and contains a sequence of sub nodes that define the timeline of the ROM
module. The possible sub nodes are:

':<inline>:' The content of the '<inline>' node is assigned to the content
  of the ROM module.

':<sleep>:' Sleeps a number of milliseconds as specified via the 'milliseconds'
  attribute.

:'<empty>:' Removes the ROM module.

At the end of the timeline, the timeline re-starts at the beginning.
