The 'nit_fb' server provides a single session of the 'Input' and 'Framebuffer'
services by presenting a Nitpicker view at a predefined screen position. If
instantiated multiple times, it can be used to statically arrange multiple
virtual frame buffers on one physical screen. The size and screen position
of each 'nit_fb' instance can be defined via Genode's configuration mechansim
using the following attributes of the 'nit_fb' config node:

! <config xpos="100" ypos="150" width="300" height="200" />
