This is a small example virtual machine monitor, that uses the base-hw kernel
as secure-world micro-hypervisor on ARM TrustZone platforms.  The VMM
configures TrustZone hardware in a way, that allows a guest to access nearly
all devices, and the DDR-RAM. Only few resources needed by the kernel (timer,
SRAM) aren't accessable by the virtual-machine.

Moreover, the VMM prepares the guest memory with a Linux image, and ramdisk,
and boots it. For the Linux guest to work properly a small patch, and tweaked
configuration is needed.
