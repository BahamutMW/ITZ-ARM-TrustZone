Abstract
########

This is a short tutorial that depicts a handy way to get a Genode ELF-image,
build with 'base-hw', started on the PandaBoard A2. For informations
about how to build Genode images with 'base-hw', have a look at
'<GENODE_DIR>/repos/base-hw/doc/hw.txt'. This tutorial is dedicated to common
Linux systems, but all examples originate from a Ubuntu 11.10.


Tutorial
########

Connect the PandaBoard to your local Ethernet through its RJ45 connector.
Additionally connect the PandaBoard to your machine through its COM port.
Ensure that you have installed the genode tool chain that is available at:

:[http://genode.org/download/tool-chain]:
  Genode tool-chain

Ensure that '<GENODE_TOOL_CHAIN_DIR>/bin/' is in your 'PATH' variable.
Get the Linaro U-Boot repository and compile U-Boot for PandaBoard:

! git clone git://git.linaro.org/boot/u-boot-linaro-stable.git
! cd <UBOOT_DIR>
! make CROSS_COMPILE=genode-arm- omap4_panda_config
! make CROSS_COMPILE=genode-arm-

During the compilation i had some errors. The first was in assembly code,
it seemed to originate from a slip with the typo and was easy to fix.
The second kind of errors occured because the GCC version had no support for
direct array initialization, thus i avoided them by simply initialize
the array elements separately.

Now install the following packages to communicate with the PandaBoard:

! apt-get install tftp-hpa minicom

Open '/etc/default/tftpd-hpa' with a text editor and ensure that it has
the following content:

! TFTP_USERNAME="tftp"
! TFTP_DIRECTORY="/var/lib/tftpboot"
! TFTP_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:69"
! TFTP_OPTIONS="-l"

Tell TFTP wich image to provide:

! cd /var/lib/tftpboot/
! ln -s <GENODE_BOOT_ELF> image.elf

Where '<GENODE_BOOT_ELF>' is the absolute path of the targeted ELF image.
Start TFTP to enable the upload of the image:

! service tftp-hpa restart

Start Minicom in configuration mode:

! minicom -s

Go to 'Serial port setting' and ensure that the device is set to the
TTY of the COM port you've conntected PandaBoard with. In my case it was
'/dev/ttyS0'. Configure the other settings for a baud rate of '115200',
8 bit char length, no parity and 1 stop bit. Quit Minicom and start
it once more:

! minicom

Mount your SD-card and copy the U-Boot files to its boot partition:

! cd <UBOOT_DIR>; cp MLO /media/boot/; cp u-boot.bin /media/boot/

Unmount the SD card and insert it into the appropriate PandaBoard slot.
Plug in the power connector or push the 'S1' button if the PandaBoard is
already powered. Minicom should now show the following message below some
bootloader info:

! Hit any key to stop autoboot:

We have to stop autoboot and type in this line to load and boot the genode
image via ethernet:

! usb start; dhcp; bootelf 0x82000000

Now your Genode scenario should start and offer its debug output
in Minicom. You can boot other images by redirecting the link
'/var/lib/tftpboot/image.elf' accordingly, restarting your PandaBoard
and instructing U-boot again as described above.
