This is generic part of the Genode implementation. It consists of two parts:

:_Core_: is the ultimate root of the Genode application tree
  and provides abstractions for the lowest-level hardware resources
  such as RAM, ROM, CPU, and generic device access. All generic parts of Core
  can be found here - for system-specific implementations refer to the
  appropriate 'base-<system>' directory.

:_Base libraries and protocols_: that are used by each Genode component
  to interact with other components. This is the glue that holds everything
  together.
