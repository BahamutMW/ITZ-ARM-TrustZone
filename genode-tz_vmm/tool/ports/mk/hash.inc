# \brief  Utilities for generating and checking port hashes

#
# The hash depends on the content of the port description file and the
# patches originating from REP_DIR. Patches that are downloaded are already
# captured by the hash sums of the downloaded files, which are declared in the
# port description file.
#
# During development when the files of MAKEFILE_LIST often change, the
# keeping all port hashes up to date is an inconvenience. By setting
# STRICT_HASH to 'no', the MAKEFILE_LIST can be exluded.
